* NodeJs :
    - JS runtime environment ( execute JS code outside the browser)
    - NodeJs is C++ program and needs V8 engine to understand JS code that’s why you will find V8 folder in dependencies 
    - NodeJs is C++ program so you can combine between features in JS and Features inC++
    - Lib folder in dependencies help developers to access C++ features from JS 
    - In NodeJs you don’t have access to web Api

* Modules :
    A module is an encapsulated and reusable chunk of code that has its own context
    In Node.js, each file is treated as a separate module
    Types of Modules :
        1.Local modules - Modules that we create in our application ( like commonJs and ES module)
        2.Built-in modules - Modules that Node.js ships with out of the box
        3.Third party modules - Modules written by other developers that we can use in our application

* commonJs Module (require) : 
    require() is a built-in function to include external modules that exist in separate files. 
    require() statement basically reads a JavaScript file, executes it , 
    and return the module.exports object. ( require("./add.js") has the value of module.exports = add; in add.js file )

* Module Scope :
    Each loaded module in Node.js is wrapped with an IIFE that provides private scoping of code
    IIFE allows you to repeat variable or function names without any conflicts 
    (batman.js and superman.js has same variable name (superhero) and no conflict when we used require in index.js)
    * under the hood when you write require("./batman") and require("./superman") in index.js
    node will wrap then with IIFE ( you can see exp. of wrapping like in iife.js)
    * under the hood node inject 5 arguments (exports, require, module,__filename,__dirname ) when wrap module by iife

* difference between module.exports and exports ?
    module.exports is an object (which's returned from require() ) and exports just a reference to this object
    
    [1] when you write exports = superhero; in superman.js and try to console.log(require("./superman)) 
        - module.exports = {};
        - let exports = module.exports; now exports reference to module.exports object
        - exports = superhero; now you overwrite exports and break the reference
        - console.log(require("./superman)); will give you {}
    [2]  when you write exports.superhero = superhero; in superman.js and try to console.log(require("./superman))
        - module.exports = {}
        - let exports = module.exports; now exports reference to module.exports object
        - exports.superman = superhero; now same reference and you added superman property to same object
        - console.log(require("./superman)); will give you {superman : "Superman"}
    [3] when you write module.exports = superhero; in batman.js and try to console.log(require("./batman))
        - module.exports = {}
        - let exports = module.exports;
        - module.exports = superhero;
        - console.log(require("./superman)); will give you "Batman"


* ES Module : 
    if you want to use ES Module (export and import) instead of using commonJs ( module.exports and require())
    name file extension mjs ( like main.mjs and math.mjs)

* Importing JSON File : 
    when you create JSON file ( data.json ) you can use require("./data") directly no need to add module.exports = data; in JSON file
    and require will parse json data to js object automatically

* watch mode in nodeJs :
    supported from version 18 (node --watch file name)

* built-n Module ( path , events , fs , stream , http )

* Path check index.js

* Events (Built-in) : 
    steps : 
    [1] import EventEmitter Class const EventEmitter = require("node:events");
    [2] create emitter instance from EventEmitter Class ( emitter instance has on and emitt methods)
    [3] emitter.on (like addEventListener )
    [4] emitter.emitt ( like click or disptaching the event ) ( you can add arguments starting from 2nd parameters)

* Extend with buil-in Event check index.js
